            <p id="buildParagraph">April 21, 2024</p>
            <p id="buildParagraph" >Despite developmenent starting a month prior, this was the very first build of the game. Mostly was created to make sure I hadn't screwed up the project settings (like for my last project). It included a rough stylized start screen, and the basics of all games. The game had a pixelation shader applied to everything, that is now being used for other cases.</p>

            <p  id="buildParagraph">April 28, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">Showcasing the earliest form of an actual game, with a minigame. Improved the experimental start screen. There was still not a clear enough direction of a main gameplay loop at this time, but there was a very bare-bones FPS system.</p>

            <p  id="buildParagraph">May 19, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">This build did have a showcase, but was never released because I wanted to combine it with a later build. It really only added a landing sequence, launching sequence, and an imersive orbiting sequence. Along with a custom VHS shader for the game. I experimented with a HUD rendered entirely in 3D space. I have since reverted back to a typical 2D user interface. </p>

            <p  id="buildParagraph">June 12, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">Included a showcase with parts of the last build, but mostly focused on a super rough and early intro mission for the game that was planned to serve as the tutorial. A mission that has completely been scraped as of writing this. Also added the first FPS animations, and a better FPS system (still basic).</p>

            <p  id="buildParagraph">July 29, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">Focused around an in-depth space combat system, lore cutscenes, and heavy refinement of that intro mission. I also gave alot more depth to the FPS system by adding secondary weapons (grenades and throwing knives), levels and skills, and inventory systems.</p>

            <h1  id="buildText">SIXTH BUILD</h1>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">November 6, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildParagraph">Many many things were added between the nearly 4 months that had passed since the last build. This build was going to have a showcase displaying a basic tutorial sequence, but I ultimately decided to wait and improve the tutorial dialog, actions, NPCs, and other things before creating a showcase. The tutorial is designed to teach the player the "Tactical" or "Mil-sim" fps mechanics of my game. Many of which have already been properly implemented by the time this build came out.  </p>
