    <h1 style="text-align: center;">BUILDS</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-family: PixeloidSans;">I make a new build of the game every time I think theres a substantial enough of an improvement from the last one.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; text-align: center; font-family: PixeloidSans;">(I would have the actual showcases if there wasn't a size limit on github)</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>First Build</h2>
    <p>April 21, 2024</p> 
    <p style="font-family: PixeloidSans;">First build was really just making me sure I could build the game and hadn't broken anything (like for my last project). Also super early experimental start screen.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Second Build</h2>
    <p>April 28, 2024</p>
    <p style="font-family: PixeloidSans;">Showcasing the earliest form of an actual game, with a minigame. Improved the experimental start screen. There was still not a clear enough direction of a main gameplay loop at this time.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Third Build (fakeh)</h2>
    <p>May 19, 2024</p>
    <p style="font-family: PixeloidSans;">This build did have a showcase, but was never released because I wanted to combine it with a later build. It really only added a landing sequence, launching sequence, and an imersive orbiting sequence. Along with a custom VHS shader for the game.</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Third Build (reahl)</h2>
    <p>June 12, 2024</p>
    <p style="font-family: PixeloidSans;">Mostly focused on a super rough and early intro mission for the game. A mission that has completely been scraped as of writing this. Also added the first FPS animations, and a better FPS system (still basic).</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Fourth Build</h2>
    <p>July 29, 2024</p>
    <p style="font-family: PixeloidSans;">Focused around an in-depth space combat system, along with lore cutscenes, heavy refinement of that intro mission, and giving more depth to the FPS system.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Fifth Build</h2>
