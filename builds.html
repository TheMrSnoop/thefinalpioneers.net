            <p id="buildText">April 21, 2024</p>
            <p id="buildText" style="font-family: PixeloidSans; ">Despite developmenent starting a month prior, this was the very first build of the game. Mostly was created to make sure I hadn't screwed up the project settings (like for my last project). It included a rough stylized start screen, and the basics of all games. The game had a pixelation shader applied to everything, that is now being used for other cases.</p>

            <p  id="buildText" style="font-family: PixeloidSans; ">Showcasing the earliest form of an actual game, with a minigame. Improved the experimental start screen. There was still not a clear enough direction of a main gameplay loop at this time, but there was a very bare-bones FPS system.</p>

            <p  id="buildText">May 19, 2024</p>
            <p  id="buildText" style="font-family: PixeloidSans; ">This build did have a showcase, but was never released because I wanted to combine it with a later build. It really only added a landing sequence, launching sequence, and an imersive orbiting sequence. Along with a custom VHS shader for the game. I experimented with a HUD rendered entirely in 3D space. I have since reverted back to a typical 2D user interface. </p>

            <p  id="buildText" style="font-family: PixeloidSans; ">Mostly focused on a super rough and early intro mission for the game. A mission that has completely been scraped as of writing this. Also added the first FPS animations, and a better FPS system (still basic).</p>

            <p  id="buildText" style="font-family: PixeloidSans; ">Focused around an in-depth space combat system, lore cutscenes, and heavy refinement of that intro mission. I also gave alot more depth to the FPS system by adding secondary weapons (grenades and throwing knives), levels and skills, and inventory systems.</p>
