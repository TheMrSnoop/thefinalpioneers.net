    <h1 >What's the game about?</h1>
    <p >The Last Pioneers at its core, is a co-op PVE First Person Shooter. It takes place in the year 1994, in an alternate timeline where the space race continues, and the USSR doesn't collapse. This results in a massive war being fought in space. You and your squadron (other players) fight the soviets in ground and space battles around the solar system. As you progress through the game you uncover the hidden secrets that were being neglected all along. </p>
    <br>
    <h1 >What programs do I use?</h1>
    <p >I use Unreal Engine 5 and Blueprint programming to create the game. As well as blender for 3D models and animations, Audacity for sound design, and GIMP for photoshopping.</p>
    <br>
    <h1 >When do you plan to release the game?</h1>
    <p>I plan to release the first trailer by June 2025, and to launch the game the summer after.</p>
