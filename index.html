    <h1 style="text-align: center;">GAME IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">NOTHING IS FINAL. Keep in mind all information shared is just where my mind is at right now, and can definitely (and probably will) change before the game comes out. Also I know this website is pretty bad on mobile devices, I'll fix that eventually. </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>The website is ready to go public!</h2>
    <p>9.29.24</p>
    <p>After some time away from making the actual game, the website is finally ready for its own public domain. I plan to update this, but I might forget sometimes. This is really just a side project that will evolve alongside the game itself. The next showcase, which has been 4 months in the making, will probably come out sometime in November, and will focus around refined FPS combat. </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
    <h2>THE CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>The Last Pioneers is a singleplayer Tactical First Person Shooter set in space. This FPS includes mil-sim and realistic mechanics. You travel the solar system to complete a variety of combat missions and objectives. <br><br> 
    <br>
    <h2 >STORY</h2>
    <p>It takes place in the year 2035, only a few months after Soviet rouge AI took control of nuclear weapons, destroyed Earth, and killed 90% of the human race. Despite this, war continues among the 2 global powers. The remaining humans are forced to live on space colonies, or join the military. You play as a soldier in the United States Space Force, and are given combat objectives that allow you to explore various parts of the solar system to fight for freedom.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>MAPS</h2>
    <p>The entire game is played on seperate maps, or landing zones around the solar system. I'm still not sure how many, and which exactly, but moons and planets will be in the game, and as of right now, I plan to include Earth, The Moon, Mars, Europa, and Titan. Each one of these planets/moons will have 2-3 maps on it, some of those maps will be on the ground, a few will be in orbit around that planet/moon. Each map has a corresponding mission.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 >PROGRAMS</h2>
    <p >I use Unreal Engine 5.4 and Blueprint programming to create the game (No C++ for now).  As well as Blender for 3D models and animations, Audacity for sound design, GIMP for graphic design, and Davinci Resolve 19 for video editing.  I try to make as much as I can on my own, but I do use a few free and paid assets.</p>
    <br>
