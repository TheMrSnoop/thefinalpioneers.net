    <h1 style="text-align: center;">IMPORTANT NOTE</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">NOTHING IS FINAL. Keep in mind all information shared is just where my mind is at right now, and can definitely (and probably will) change before the game comes out. Also I know this website is pretty bad on mobile devices, I'll fix that eventually.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>The website is ready to go public!</h2>
    <p>9.28.24</p>
    <p>After some time away from making the actual game, the website is finally ready for its own public domain. I plan to update this, but I might forget sometimes. This is really just a side project that will evolve alongside the game itself. The next showcase , which has been 2 months in the making, will probably come out sometime next month, and will focus around refined FPS combat.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
    <h2 >THE CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>The Last Pioneers is a singleplayer First Person Shooter. This FPS includes mil-sim and realistic mechanics. You travel the solar system to attack and complete a variety of combat missions. Some on foot, others in orbit. These orbital missions consist of space combat gameplay.<br> <br> Heist missions require you to break into a base, steal intel, planting a bomb and escaping in time. Survival missions require you to survive a wave of enemy reinforcements. Interception missions allow you to pilot a space fighter ship, to combat enemy starships to complete an objective. Each map has a core gamemode that is specifically tailored for that map. Every mission has a 50% chance of applying a "Mission Modifier". These mission modifers shake up the core gamemode, helping replayablity.<br><br> At the beginning of each mission, the player chooses their class. Commandos are brute-like exomechs that are able to use the "Heavy" type of weapon. Assassins are stealthy builds that use a range of snipers, revolvers, and pistols. Cybersoldiers can use a range of hacks. These hacks can be used to quickly kill a large ammount of enemies at once. </p>
    <br>
    <h2 >PROGRAMS</h2>
    <p >I use Unreal Engine 5.4 and Blueprint programming to create the game (No C++ for now).  As well as Blender for 3D models and animations, Audacity for sound design, and GIMP for photoshopping different things. I try to make as much as I can on my own, but I do use a few free and paid assets.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 >STORY</h2>
    <p>It takes place in the year 2044, 10 years after Soviet rouge AI took control of nuclear weapons, and destroyed Earth. Despite this, war continues among the 2 global powers. The remaining humans are forced to live on space colonies, or join the military. You're so focused on killing each other, so oblivious... </p>
