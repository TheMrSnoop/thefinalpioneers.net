    <h1 style="text-align: center;">LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>The website is ready to go public!</h2>
    <p>9.16.24</p>
    <p>After some time away from making the actual game, the website is finally ready for its own public domain. I plan to update this, but I might forget sometimes. Keep in mind all information shared is just where my mind is at right now, and can definitely (and probably will) change before the game comes out. Also I know this website is pretty bad on mobile devices, I'll fix that eventually. </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
    <h2 >THE CONCEPT</h2>
    <p>The Last Pioneers is a PVE First Person Shooter. The United States Space Force tasks you and your squadron (other players), to go around diffrent planets and moons in the solar system to complete a range of diffrent combat missions. Some missions may require you to break into a base, and planting a bomb. Other missions may require you to survive a wave of enemy reinforcements. Each map has a core gamemode that is specifically tailored for that map. <br><br> At the beginning of each save, every player chooses their class. Commandos are brute like exomechs that are able to use the "Heavy" type of weapon. Assassins are stealthy players that use a range of snipers, revolvers, and pistols. Cybersoldiers can use a range of hacks. These hacks can be beneficial to the squadron, like healing low players, or they can be used to quickly kill a large ammount of enemies at once.  </p>
    <br>
    <h2 >PROGRAMS</h2>
    <p >I use Unreal Engine 5 and Blueprint programming to create the game. As well as Blender for 3D models and animations, Audacity for sound design, and GIMP for photoshopping different things.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 >STORY</h2>
    <p>It takes place in the year 2044, in an alternate timeline where the space race continues, and the USSR renames itself to the TCRS, or The Communist Republic of Sol. The space race leads to a space war, and you and your squadron fight the soviets in ground and space battles around the solar system. As you progress through the game you uncover the hidden secrets that were being neglected all along.</p>
