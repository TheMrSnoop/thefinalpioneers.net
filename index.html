    <h2>The website is ready to go public!</h2>
    <p>9.14</p>
    <p>After some time away from making the actual game, the website is finally ready for its own public domain. I plan to update this, but I might forget sometimes. Keep in mind all information shared is just where my mind is at right now, and can definitely change before the game comes out. </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
    <h2 >THE GAME</h2>
    <p>The Last Pioneers at its core, is a co-op PVE First Person Shooter. It takes place in the year 2044, in an alternate timeline where the space race continues, and the USSR renames itself to the TCRS, or The Communist Republic of Sol. The space race leads to a full on space war, and you and your squadron (other players) fight the soviets in ground and space battles around the solar system. As you progress through the game you uncover the hidden secrets that were being neglected all along. </p>
    <br>
    <h2 >PROGRAMS</h2>
    <p >I use Unreal Engine 5 and Blueprint programming to create the game. As well as blender for 3D models and animations, Audacity for sound design, and GIMP for photoshopping different things.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 >RELEASE DATE</h2>
    <p>I plan to release the first trailer by June 2025, and to launch the game the summer after.</p>
    <br>
